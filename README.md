Autistic people tend to show difficulties to identify emotions from facial expres-
sions. Music, Emotions, Brain activity and Autism is a project that analyses the
use of music on autistic children in order to improve their skills when identifying
emotions from facial gestures.

This repository contains a video game for android platforms which combines song with images and
facial expressions to test the effectivity of music as tool outside experimental conditions.
